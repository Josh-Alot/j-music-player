# BluJ Music Player

A simple music player created for educational purposes.

## Why Are you making a music player? There are a lot of alternatives on the internet

Because i like to play music and i like to code, this is enough reasons for me to try to make an app like this

## Why are you using Angular for this?

Because it's the framework that i'm most familiarized, but i'm still felling that i'm not good enough on it

## Why BluJ?

Because of my nickname, Josh, and the bird blue jay, i'm a fan of Mordecai from Regular Show.

## Next Steps

I'll keep this file updated with my next steps in case i forget what i have to do:

- Create or find an API that download a list of songs and metadatas
- Make the music play when i click on the play button and pause when i click on the pause button
- Change the song when i click on forward or backdard buttons
- Make another component for list all the songs and play the song i select
